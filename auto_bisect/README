This directory contains modules related to tools for bisecting regressions.

There are several different tools for bisecting regressions; the main use
of these tools is to find revisions where a performance regression occurred.
These tools are generally run by trybots but can also be run locally.

        modules including run-bisect-perf-regression.py.
  src/tools/run-bisect-manual-test.py
     -- a script which is used to manually bisect regressions; this also
        depends on bisect-perf-regression.py.
  src/tools/bisect-perf-regression.py
